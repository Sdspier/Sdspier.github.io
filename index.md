I am a senior Software Engineering student at [SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu). This degree will be adding on to a previous B.A. in Applied Mathematics from [The University of Vermont](www.uvm.edu). 

Most recently I have been working on a research project under the advisement of [Bastian Tenbergen](http://bastian.tenbergen.org), involving the development of a [Traffic Collision Avoidance System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system). This project has been adapted to be part of my senior capstone course, which will culminate this December.([Project Paper](http://Sdspier.github.io/doc/sspierXPlaneReport.pdf))

In the summers of 2015 and 2016, I interned at [BAE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Inc.) Electronics Systems division, where I was tasked with converting existing mathematical functions in the project's baseline from MATLAB to C and C++, and updating legacy software algorithms used in radio frequency and geo-location applications.
