I will be graduating from [SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu), with my B.S. in Software Engineering. I recently worked on a research project under the advisement of [Bastian Tenbergen](http://bastian.tenbergen.org), involving the development of a [Traffic Collision Avoidance System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system), and am currently continuing this project as part of my senior capstone course. ([Project Paper](http://Sdspier.github.io/Documents/sspierXPlaneReport.pdf))

In the summer of 2015, I interned at [BAE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Inc.), where I was tasked with converted existing mathematical functions in the project's baseline from MATLAB to C and C++ by using existing sources and writing new functions. I was able to contribute more portable and reusable code for future use, and by other teams.
